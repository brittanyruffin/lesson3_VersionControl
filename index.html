            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system is the way changes to files, documents, computer programs, websites and other information gets managed. These changes are documented by their revision number. These revisions are accompanied with a timestamp and who was making the revisions. This creates a much easier way for files to be stored that have had many different edits done to it. It is hard to keep hundreds and hundreds of files organized unless you use the version control system. This is especially important to coders who are dealing with files and editing them constantly. This topic interested me because I didn’t know there was such a system to organize files and keep track of revisions like this. It’s relevant to the course because this is a very helpful tool to those in this industry of coding.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that is used to track changes among computer files and coordinate these changes among multiple people. This allows for more than one person to work on certain files and there not be any confusion or disruption. It is made to be fast and efficient, uphold the integrity of the data being entered and helps the workflow of multiple people on the same file. This interested me for a similar reason as VCS did. I did not know there were systems for this type of file management. I feel that this is crucial for anyone working in software development, especially if it is within a team.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is a repository that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple people. The purpose of this is to publish the code you have made to the public and allow them to read or write it. This is when you git push your commits to a remote repository or when you git push someone else’s commits from it. I thought this was interesting because this allows multiple people to work on a project rather than just one person. This is relevant to our course because many people who are coding are most likely working in a team.

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is different than a remote repository. A local repository is one that resides on a local machine of an individual user. The main difference between these two repositories is that one allows for multiple people to access and edit the code and one only allows for one person to access it. You can create a local repository by creating a brand new one or closing an existing remote repository onto your own machine. I found this one interesting because you can take from a remote repository and put it into your own where only you can access and edit it. This is relevant to our course because this teaches us that we can pull from other repositories.

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are a wide varied of GIT commands that can be used. The basic commands include git init, git add, git commit, git log and git status. The remote commands include git remote, git pull and git push. The git add command takes what you have on your working copy and adds it to a staging area or “cache”. Git commit means you are adding it to the local repository. Git push will take that file from the local to the remote repository. Those are just a few of the commands that are used. This is relevant to our course because we are working with GIT and it teaches us what these commands do exactly when we are coding them.
